Consider separate models for Motion for Summary Judgement and Motion to Dismiss

Reading in the data. All columns not specified use ReadR's default. 

Many values specified as characters will be later converted to factors, if needed. (Additionally, the MUDAC_ID column is left as a CHAR across all datasets for simpler joining.)


```{r}
train_dockets <- read_csv(
  "train_dockets.csv",
  col_types = cols(
  circuit = col_character(),
  district = col_character(),
  diversity_residence = col_character(),
  filers_county = col_character(),
  jurisdiction = col_character(),
  mudac_id = col_character(),
  nos_code = col_character(),
  office = col_character(),
  origin_at_filing = col_character(),
  pro_se = col_character(),
  settled = col_logical(),
  summary_judgment = col_logical()
  )
  )

train_other_motions <-
  read_csv("train_other_motions.csv",
  col_types = cols(mudac_id = col_character()))
  
train_terminating_motions <-
  read_csv("train_terminating_motions.csv",
  col_types = cols(mudac_id = col_character()))

district_fips_code <- read_csv(
  "district_fips_code.csv",
  col_types = cols(district_number = col_character(),
  fips_code = col_character())
  )
  
districts <-
  read_csv("districts.csv", col_types = cols(district_number = col_character()))
  
```

```{r}
##The dataset we're working with is small enough that we'll be fine merging these together

merged_district_with_fips <-
  left_join(district_fips_code, districts, by = c("district_number", "state")) %>% 
  rename(census_2010_district_population = census_2010_population)

##Also, going to merge this information into the main one just to make it easier for humans to read.  
train_dockets <- left_join(train_dockets, districts, by = c("district" = "district_number"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(train_dockets, aes(x = year_filed)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, colour="black", fill="indianred4")

ggplot(train_dockets,
       aes(x = year_filed,
       fill = outcome)) +
       geom_bar(position = "fill") 

##it might be worth considering a filter for 2020 if we include a year factor in the final model due to the very low number of cases for 2020
##a difference visible in the distribution of outcomes

ggplot(train_dockets, 
       aes(x = district, fill = circuit)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack")

summary(lm(summary_judgment ~ circuit, data = train_dockets))
summary(lm(settled ~ circuit, data = train_dockets))

summary(temp)

ggplot(train_dockets, 
       aes(x = nos_code, fill = circuit)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

##Ask Barbara what to do with this extreme imbalance
Anova(lm(train_dockets$nos_code ~ train_dockets$circuit), type = 2)

##The huge spike is the Illinois Northern district, which services the city of Chicago 
##Similarly, the second highest is the Eastern Michigan district, representing Detroit, and so on for other large cities
